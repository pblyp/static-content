    <p>If you're visiting this site and you're not a bot or a web crawler, there is little possibility that we are acquainted.</p>
    <p>I do React-on-SmartTV development for a living and occasionally produce music for fun.</p>
    <p>This web site's birthday is 31 December 2021 and it currently consists of pure HTML and CSS which should be fully supported by any web browser aware of responsive layout. My current intention (read: I don't promise this to myself!) is to let this page be as simple as possible to be at least readable with something like Lynx</p>
    <p>You may want to see my <a href="https://github.com/pblyp">Github profile</a>.</p>
